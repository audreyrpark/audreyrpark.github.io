# Final Project: Chakraborty with Excess Deaths

I worked with [Sydney Alexander](https://sydalexander.github.io/) to do a reanalysis of Chakraborty's study using excess deaths rather than COVID-19 deaths. This takes into account deaths that could have been associated with the COVID-19 pandemic but weren't necessarily caused directly by COVID––for example, deaths of despair.
