## Is GIS a Science?
I have mostly studied GIS as a tool thus far, and I'm not sure it should count as a science. In my Jterm Human Geography with GIS class, we learned how to use GIS to come up with concrete numbers and reports as a step in the process to analyze data. The nature of the course was to learn the steps within GIS to reach the same conclusion as a class, much as one would use a calculator. I would like to learn how to use GIS  to answer more complex questions, help create a more complete story, and to use its outputs as more than just a tool.
