# Social Vulnerability Index: Replicating Spielman et. al

I worked with [Andy Cao](https://andreyjcao.github.io/) and [Grace Sokolow](https://gsokolow.github.io/) in replicating this study, focusing on creating and improving tables and figures in the study as well as reweighting the social vulnerability index model. We readjusted the additive model by weighting the SoVI components by percent variance explained. This tested internal consistency of the study.
