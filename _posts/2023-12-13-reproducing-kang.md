## Reproducing Kang et al

In the 2020 study, Kang et al aimed to measure hospital accessibility by access to hospitals within a 10, 20, or 30 minute service area and resources at each hospital based on the number of available ventilators and beds. This study was based in Illinois.

I worked with [Andy Cao](https://andreyjcao.github.io/) and [Grace Sokolow](https://gsokolow.github.io/) to improve Kang et al's study, focusing on improving the speed limit calculations and final visualizations.
